Glyph Drawing Club
=====================

[GlyphDrawing.club](http://www.glyphdrawing.club/) is a new and versatile online text art and modular design editor. It's inspired by the limitations and possibilities of old school ASCII art editors, but brought to modern times; the editor is based on an adjustable grid into which typographic symbols can be inserted from any font. It's best suitable for creating modular type design, illustrations, ASCII art, concrete poetry and more.
